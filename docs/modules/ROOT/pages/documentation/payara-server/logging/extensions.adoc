= Payara Java Util Logging Extensions

_Since version 5.2021.4_

In version 5.2021.4 we radically reworked the logging used by the server to fix several issues caused
by architectural decisions made years ago in old Glassfish versions, optimize logging and make it's
configuration also more flexible.

That means also changes in the configuration.

== New Features

* our formatters are based on DateTimeFormatter instead of SimpleDateFormat now
* formatters can be configured by properties relative to handlers.
* you can use JUL log handlers and formatters instead of ours
  (but then you cannot use features implemented just for Payara Server Community handlers)
* when the logging.properties file is saved from the application server, properties are sorted by name
* more consistent reconfigurations
* it is possible to log also bootstrapping of the server
* it is possible to trace the logging system too (in extreme cases)
