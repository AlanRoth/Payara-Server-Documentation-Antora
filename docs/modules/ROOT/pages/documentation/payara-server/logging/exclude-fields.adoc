= Exclude Fields

All the three log formatters `ODLLogFormatter`, `UniformLogFormatter`, and `JSONLogFormatter` support the possibility to exclude some fields from the log entries.  This makes the log file more compact and removes unnecessary information in the case you do not need it or want to use it.


You can change the `com.sun.enterprise.server.logging.GFFileHandler.excludeFields` within the _<PAYARA_HOME>/glassfish/domains/<domain-name>/config/logging.properties_ file or use the Admin Console or an `asadmin` command.

When the configuration is changed when the server is running, a log rotation happens so that a log file always contains the same set of information.

== Using the Admin Console

To configure the excluded fields in the log entries, select them on the Logger settings screen.

[[using-asadmin-utility]]
== Using an `asadmin` command

Use the following command to change the excluded fields:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-log-attributes com.sun.enterprise.server.logging.GFFileHandler.excludeFields=tid,version
----

Multiple fields must be separated by a `,` and no additional spaces should be included.

[[fields-description]]
