= Daily Log Rotation
_Since version 5.184_

Log file rotation keeps log files manageable and organized, as old log files are automatically deleted
when they pass a given threshold, instead of staying on the system and eventually running the system
out of disk space.

Rotation on Date Change means that the file is rolled at the start of the next day.

== Enabling Daily Rotation

You can enable daily log file rotation by checking this box in Admin UI:

image:logging/daily-log-rotation.png[Daily rotation config]

The same can be done by executing the following command:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> asadmin set-log-attributes fish.payara.jul.handler.PayaraLogHandler.rotation.rollOnDateChange=true

fish.payara.jul.handler.PayaraLogHandler.rotation.rollOnDateChange logging attribute value set to true.
The logging attributes are saved successfully for server.

Command set-log-attributes executed successfully.
----

As an alternative you can use the File Rotation Time Limit, then the file is rolled after given count of minutes.

Both time-based rules can be combined also with the File Rotation Limit - then the file is rolled also after
the log record was written, if the file size is greater than this limit.
