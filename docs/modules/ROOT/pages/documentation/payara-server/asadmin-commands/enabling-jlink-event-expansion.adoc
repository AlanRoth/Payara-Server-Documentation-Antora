= Enable JLink Event Expansion

When escaping characters in the CLI and Asadmin multimode using the \ character JLink removes the escape character for any character. This occured due to JLink updating from 2.x to 3.x, previously, the escape character was only removed for special characters. 

Due to this, JLink Event Expansion can now be enabled and disabled.

This is disabled by default.
