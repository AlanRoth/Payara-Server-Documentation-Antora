[[what-is-grpc]]
== What is gRPC?

The gRPC is a modern open-source high performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework that use HTTP2 and simplifies the communication with protocol buffers to share data between client and server. By enabling gRPC Payara is giving more options to create services accepted on the market.

[[what-can-we-do-with-it]]
== What can we do with it?

* We can create services more efficient than REST.
* Use HTTP2 to provide full duplex communication between the client and the service.
* Use protol buffers to optimize and simplify communication.
* Enables bidirectional-streaming out-of-the-box.

The gRPC support provide the means for users to use the gRPC style service programming.

[[installing-grpc-server-support-module]]
== Installing gRPC Server Support Module

You need to clone the following repo on your environment: https://github.com/payara/gRPC .

Example: 
[source, shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/payara/gRPC
----

After cloning the repository you need to build and drop the JAR from the target generated files into the `${PAYARA_HOME}/glassfish/modules` directory of your Payara Server Installation.

Example:
[source, shell]
----
cd grpc
mvn clean install
cd grpc/grpc-support/target
cp grpc-support-1.0.0.jar ${PAYARA_HOME}/glassfish/modules
----
Restart the domain and any running instances to enable the module.

[[preparing-grpc-service-in-a-web-application]]
== Preparing a gRPC Service in a Web Application.

To prepare the service gRPC application you need the following:

* Create a sample web application.
* Include configuration for empty context root.
* Create the protobuf service difinition file.
* Include build dependencies. 
* Configure build section.
* Build service.
* Extend service implementation.
* Deploy service application.

[[create-sample-web-application]]
=== Create a sample web application

Create a sample web application project using the following Maven archetype:

Example:
[source, shell]
----
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=fish.payara.samples -DartifactId=payara-web -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp -DinteractiveMode=false
----

[[include-configuration-for-empty-context-root]]
=== Include configuration for empty context root

You need to create a maven web application with empty context-root */*. You can add the the following payara-web.xml file to the WEB-INF folder of your application:

[source, xml]
----
<!DOCTYPE payara-web-app PUBLIC "-//Payara.fish//DTD Payara Server 4 Servlet 3.0//EN" "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/payara/Payara-Server-Documentation/master/schemas/payara-web-app_4.dtd">
<payara-web-app>
 <context-root>/</context-root>
</payara-web-app>
----

IMPORTANT: The context-root */* is a restriction based on the gRPC style programming and it is because standard gRPC clients expect no base path on the requests.

[[create-the-protobuf-service-definition-file]]
=== Create the protobuf service difinition file

You need to use the protobuf protocol in order to declare your service. Here's a sample 'helloworld' protobuf definition example:

[source, proto]
----
syntax = "proto3";
option java_multiple_files = true;
option java_package = "fish.payara.samples.grpc";
option java_outer_classname = "PayaraProto";
package fish.payara.samples.grpc;
service PayaraService {
  rpc communicate (PayaraReq) returns (PayaraResp) {}
}
message PayaraReq {
  string message = 1;
}
message PayaraResp {
  string message = 1;
}
----

To summarize the content, this proto file is defining a service named PayaraService with a single method communicate with a request named PayarReq and a response PayaraResp. We can see also the content of each type with an string field named message. That will be the content of the messages to process.

The probuf file should be added under the following folder: 

* src
** main
*** proto
**** payara.proto 

NOTE: The name of the file is irrelevant, it only matters that its extension is .proto .

[[include-build-dependencies]]
=== Include build dependencies

It is needed to declare the following dependencies to build the service and generate stubs:

NOTE: It was included the jakarta.platform dependency to resolve some annotations for the web application.

Example:
[source, XML]
----
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.grpc</groupId>
            <artifactId>grpc-protobuf</artifactId>
            <version>1.43.1</version>
            <scope>provided</scope>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.grpc</groupId>
            <artifactId>grpc-stub</artifactId>
            <version>1.43.1</version>
            <scope>provided</scope>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>jakarta.platform</groupId>
            <artifactId>jakarta.jakartaee-api</artifactId>
            <version>8.0.0</version>
            <scope>provided</scope>
        </dependency>
----

* The grpc-protobuf used during the autogeneration of stubs and resolve internal proto types.
* The grpc-stub used to resolve internal types for the stubbing classes.

[[configure-build-section]]
=== Configure build section

The build section is needed to generate the stubs and service implementation.

Example:
[source, XML]
----
    <build>
      <extensions>
          <extension>
              <groupId>kr.motd.maven</groupId>
              <artifactId>os-maven-plugin</artifactId>
              <version>1.6.2</version>
          </extension>
      </extensions>
      <plugins>
          <plugin>
              <groupId>org.xolstice.maven.plugins</groupId>
              <artifactId>protobuf-maven-plugin</artifactId>
              <version>0.6.1</version>
              <configuration>
                  <protocArtifact>com.google.protobuf:protoc:3.19.2:exe:${os.detected.classifier}</protocArtifact>
                  <pluginId>grpc-java</pluginId>
                  <pluginArtifact>io.grpc:protoc-gen-grpc-java:1.43.1:exe:${os.detected.classifier}</pluginArtifact>
              </configuration>
              <executions>
                  <execution>
                      <goals>
                          <goal>compile</goal>
                          <goal>compile-custom</goal>
                      </goals>
                  </execution>
              </executions>
          </plugin>
      </plugins>
  </build>
----

* The os-maven-plugin dependency is used to identify OS properties used during generation of stubs.
* The protobuf-maven-plugin use the protobuf compiler (protoc) to generate the stubs.

[[build-service]]
=== Build Service

After doing the previous steps, you can build the project to generate the stubs. This stubs are needed to resolve the types used into the service implementation.

Example:
[source, shell]
----
${webapp root folder} > mvn clean install
----

The stubs should be generated with similar structure like the following:

image::grpc/grpc-stubs-folders.png[Stubs folders]

* target/generated-sources/protobuf/grpc-java/fish.payara.samples.grpc (*here you can see the service class*)
* target/generated-sources/protobuf/java/fish.payara.samples.grpc (*here you can see the types associated to the service*)

To implement the service's endpoint you'll have to extend the implementation base class that is nested inside the recently compile gRPC stub located under `/target/generated-sources/protobuf/grpc-java` .

[[extend-service-implementation]]
=== Extend service implementation

[source, Java]
----
@Dependent
public class PayaraService extends PayaraServiceGrpc.PayaraServiceImplBase {
    private final static Logger log = Logger.getLogger(PayaraService.class.getName());
    @Override
    public void communicate(fish.payara.samples.grpc.PayaraReq request,
                            io.grpc.stub.StreamObserver<fish.payara.samples.grpc.PayaraResp> responseObserver) {
        final String message = request.getMessage(); //getting message from the request
        log.info(String.format("Processing message: %s", message)); //printing incoming message from the request
        responseObserver.onNext(response(message)); //setting the message to the response
        responseObserver.onCompleted(); //indicating that the response is complete
    }

    private static final fish.payara.samples.grpc.PayaraResp response(String message) {
        return fish.payara.samples.grpc.PayaraResp.newBuilder() //creating builder
                .setMessage(message) //setting response message
                .build(); //build the response
    }
}
----

Our example is a simple echo service that will print a "Hello World" message. We can see the method communicate that receive the PayaraReq and the StreamObserver<fish.payara.samples.grpc.PayaraResp> those parameters are needed to process the incomming request with the 'Hello World' message and create the response with the same incoming message.

[[deploy-service-application]]
=== Deploy service application

The final step is to deploy the application in a Payara server domain. We can do this by the use of the GUI tool or by command line as following:

image::grpc/deploy-gui-tool.png[Deploy tool]

Command Example:
[source, shell]
----
 ${PAYARA_HOME}/glassfish/bin > asadmin deploy [filelocation]/service.war
----

[[creating-sample-grpc-client-application]]
== Creating a sample gRPC client application

After deploying the server application now we can create a client. To achieve this it is needed to do the following steps:

* Create client application
* Copy stubs files to the client source directories
* Add client dependencies
* Create client implementation
* Execution of the HelloWorld application

include stub generated files to the client application. You can create a new maven application and include the stub files on a package within the application. 

[[create-client-application]]
=== Create the client application 

We can create a client application using the following Maven archetype.
Example:
[source,shell]
----
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=fish.payara.samples -DartifactId=payara-client -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
----

[[copy-stubs-files-client-source-folder]]
=== Copy stubs files to the client source folder

Manually copy the service stub files that were generated in the previous section to the following locations in the client application's source directories: 

* fish.payara.samples.grpc

Example:
[source,shell]
----
cp ${server app folder}/target/generated-sources/protobuf/grpc-java/fish.payara.samples.grpc  ${client app}/src/main/java/fish/payara/samples/grpc

cp ${server app folder}/target/generated-sources/protobuf/java/fish.payara.samples.grpc ${client app}/src/main/java/fish/payara/samples/grpc
----


[[add-client-dependencies]]
=== Add Client dependencies

The following Maven dependencies are needed to build and run the client application: 

Example:
[source,XML]
----
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.grpc</groupId>
        <artifactId>grpc-netty-shaded</artifactId>
        <version>1.43.1</version>
        <scope>runtime</scope>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.grpc</groupId>
        <artifactId>grpc-protobuf</artifactId>
        <version>1.43.1</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.grpc</groupId>
        <artifactId>grpc-stub</artifactId>
        <version>1.43.1</version>
    </dependency>
----

* The grpc-netty-shaded it is needed at runtime to create the communication Channel and send the message to the service
* The grpc-protobuf used during the autogeneration of stubs and resolve internal proto types.
* The grpc-stub used to resolve internal types for the stubbing classes.

[[create-client-implementation]]
=== Create client implementation

This is the client code to call the gRPC service deployed in Payara Server

[source, Java]
----
public class GrpcClient {
    private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(GrpcClient.class.getName());
    private final PayaraServiceGrpc.PayaraServiceStub stub; //reference to the stub service implementation class
    private CountDownLatch latch;
    private AtomicReference<Throwable> error;

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, MalformedURLException, URISyntaxException {
        URL myURL = new URL("http://localhost:8080/fish.payara.samples.grpc.PayaraService"); // url for the deployed grpc service
        final GrpcClient client = new GrpcClient(myURL); // creating client
        client.communicate(); // call service
    }

    public GrpcClient(URL url) throws URISyntaxException {
        final Channel channel = ManagedChannelBuilder.forAddress(url.getHost(), url.getPort())
                .usePlaintext().build(); //creating channel to start communication to the service
        this.stub = PayaraServiceGrpc.newStub(channel); //creating stub from the channel reference
        this.error = new AtomicReference<>(null);
    }

    public void communicate() throws InterruptedException {
        latch = new CountDownLatch(1); //this is to wait until the communication finish with the current thread
        stub.communicate(request("Hello World"), new ResponseObserver()); //calling service and adding a ResponseObserver to process response
        latch.await(20, TimeUnit.SECONDS); //timeout to wait response
    }

    public Throwable getError() {
        return error.get();
    }

    private final class ResponseObserver implements StreamObserver<PayaraResp> {

        @Override
        public void onNext(PayaraResp response) { //to process the service response
            LOGGER.log(Level.INFO, "Response received: \"{0}\".", response.getMessage()); // printing the response from the service
        }

        @Override
        public void onError(Throwable t) { //method to process errors
            LOGGER.log(Level.SEVERE, "Error received", t);
            error.set(t);
            latch.countDown();
        }

        @Override
        public void onCompleted() {
            latch.countDown(); //indicating that the communication complete for the current thread
        }

    }

    private static final PayaraReq request(String message) {
        return PayaraReq.newBuilder().setMessage(message).build(); //creating request with an String message
    }
}
----

[[execution-of-helloworl-application]]
=== Execution of the HelloWorld application

To execute the client application, build the project and run the following command:
Example:

[source,shell]
----
${client app} mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="fish.payara.samples.grpc.GrpcClient"
----

Server log: 

[source, shell]
----
