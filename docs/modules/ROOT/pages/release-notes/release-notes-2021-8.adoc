##### Client Certificate Validation Checks

After upgrading to Payara Community 5.2021.8,  a certificate that was accepted in earlier versions might be rejected now. It is no longer enough that the client certificates are included within the Payara Keystore. See [Certificate Expiration Validation :: Payara Community Documentation](https://docs.payara.fish/community/docs/documentation/payara-server/server-configuration/security/certificate-realm-certificate-validation.html#_client-certificate-expiration-validator)
