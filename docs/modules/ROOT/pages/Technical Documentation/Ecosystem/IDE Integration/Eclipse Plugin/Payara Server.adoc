. In the last step you can select resources which will be deployed on the server. Here we don't have any deployable projects in the workspace yet, so both panels are empty.

[[adding-resources]]
== Adding Resources to Server

<<<<<<< HEAD
. First import or create some project, deployable to the *Payara Server*. Here we use one of the https://github.com/javaee-samples/javaee7-samples[Java EE 7 Samples] .

. Right click the target server in the *Servers* view and click *Add and Remove...*
+
<<<<<<< HEAD:docs/modules/ROOT/pages/Technical Documentation/Ecosystem/IDE Integration/eclipse-plugin/payara-server.adoc
image::eclipse-plugin/payara-server/add-resource-menu.png[Add and Remove menu]
. Select resources you want to be managed by the *Payara Tools*, add them to the right panel and click *Finish*.
+
image::eclipse-plugin/payara-server/add-resource-window.png[Add and Remove window]
. Now you can watch the deployment of the application in the *Console* view.
+
image::eclipse-plugin/payara-server/add-resource-console.png[Add and Remove window]
. If the deployment was successful, you can use the application. Here we simply opened the internal Eclipse's browser and sent the HTTP GET request - and the application responded.
+

. You can also access the administration console directly from the Eclipse Browser. Just right click the target server in the *Servers* view and click *Payara -> View Admin Console*

[[auto-publish-hot-deploy]]
== Auto Publish & Hot Deploy

The Auto Deploy and Hot Deploy mode are helpful for developers to run and test an application immediately after making changes to its sources without restarting the Server or manual redeployment to maximize your productivity.

. To enable the automatic publishing from the Eclipse IDE, open The *Server* panel, double click the server name and expand the *Publishing* section to reconfigure the setting.
+

. The *Hot Deploy* mode can be enabled from the Payara Server properties page to boost the deployment performance which reuses the existing application instance relative to the modified source.
