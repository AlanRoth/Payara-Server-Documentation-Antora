5. In the last step you can select resources which will be deployed on the server.
  Here we don't have any deployable projects in the workspace yet, so both panels are empty.

  Here we use one of the https://github.com/javaee-samples/javaee7-samples[Java EE 7 Samples] .
2. Right click the target server in the *Servers* view and click *Add and Remove...*

5. If the deployment was successful, you can use the application.
  Here we simply opened the internal Eclipse's browser and sent the HTTP GET request - and the application responded.

6. You can also access the administration console directly from the Eclipse Browser.
  Just right click the target server in the *Servers* view and click *Payara -> View Admin Console*
